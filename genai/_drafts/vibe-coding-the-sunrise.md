With *Vibe Coding* is like with *Agile*: reasonable idea gets ruined by misunderstanding and this is progressing as the hype goes on. Let's try to understand first, what *Vibe Coding* really is.

We find an informal definition on [wikipedia][vibe-coding-definition]. As Vibe Coding we understand a completely different approach to coding, that is, a chatbot based rather than assistant based. Developer no longer works with code directly but rather develop via series of prompts and let the GenAI agent provide an implementation. Developer focus on problem definition, testing and giving feedbacks, also via prompts. If we look at simplified coding assistant anatomy diagram (see below), agent mode (the heart of the vibe coding) is the rightmost, most sophisticated and autonomous component that is finally capable of comprehending written software as a whole.
