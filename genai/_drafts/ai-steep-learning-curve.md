The generative AI bubble is a real mess, with all those bold statements flying around about 'breakthroughs', 'game-changing' developments, people losing their jobs, rewriting Wikipedia to contain 'their' truth, and the end of humanity. It's even worse in my field of software engineering. AI-powered coding tools are simultaneously "eliminating the need for coding" and "not working at all".

I cannot say that this kind of dissonance is unprecedented, because it isn't. Scepticism and enthusiasm were present with the invention of the steam machine, the bicycle and the car. Nor can I say that I haven't witnessed this myself, because that would be untrue. There was the invention of the personal computer ('people will get stupid'), the internet ('people will get stupid' --- but wait... OK, anyway...) and the mobile phone ('we'll lose our freedom by always being "on the phone"'), and finally the smartphone ('people will get stupid').

Perhaps the only difference with AI in software engineering is that I am personally involved. It's because ["AI can take my job"][when-does-ai], and because it's expected to generate unmaintainable code (because, you know, humans only develop highly maintainable, clean code). Why are there so many mixed opinions? Let's take a brief look at this problem.

### The way we feel about AI

As a big fan of systematic, scientific analysis, I have divided all software engineers with strong opinions on AI into the following four groups:

I will give you some time to collect your jaws off the floor — a clear result of this eye-opening drawing — before continuing with the development of this little theory.

Let's start with the enthusiasts. I myself am in a group called 'seasoned enthusiasts'. You could call them seniors or whatever. It's a group of people with significant experience in their profession --- software engineering, in this case. These people clearly recognise the potential of large language models. Some of them may be aware that the main driver in the development of this technology is actually their profession — big tech companies have invested billions just to address the problem of a relatively small pool of well-paid specialists. Seasoned enthusiasts have accepted this reality, either seeing it as an opportunity to quickly upskill in the AI coding area or progressing via a 'can't fight it, so join it' strategy (with exactly the same rationale). The real problem is that 'seasoned enthusiasts' are perhaps the smallest group in the population as a whole.

A much bigger group nowadays is the 'junior enthusiast', who has much less experience but is nonetheless trying to use AI in their daily work. If they are lucky, they have a good AI leader around to help them learn how to use the tools properly. If not, they have to experiment and learn through trial and error, which can be difficult (I will explain why below). However, even if they are only using the chat function (or 'ask mode' in some terminology) to ask questions related to problems with their code or technology, this may still be more efficient than searching for answers on Google or reading through Stack Overflow. Or even worse, watching tons of useless tech videos on YouTube.

### Overselling is the reason number 1

<!-- AI providers are to be blamed -->

*'You can do big things with little effort' --- they said.*

### Complexity of the technology is the reason number 2

<!-- Context building, prompt engineering -->

![You'are using that wrong](/genai/img/commando-rocket-launcher-instruction-manual.jpg)
*You're clearly using that wrong!*

### Poor usability of the tooling is the reason number 3

<!-- Messing up with tabs, fake, untransparent access to output and recently closed tabs -->

### But tools are evolving in right direction

<!-- Agentic AI -->
