The generative AI bubble is a real mess, with all those bold statements flying around about 'breakthroughs', 'game-changing' developments, people losing their jobs, rewriting Wikipedia to contain 'their' truth, and the end of humanity. It's even worse in my field of software engineering. AI-powered coding tools are simultaneously "eliminating the need for coding" and "not working at all".

I cannot say that this kind of dissonance is unprecedented, because it isn't. Scepticism and enthusiasm were present with the invention of the steam machine, the bicycle and the car. Nor can I say that I haven't witnessed this myself, because that would be untrue. There was the invention of the personal computer ('people will get stupid'), the internet ('people will get stupid' â€” but wait... OK, anyway...) and the mobile phone ('we'll lose our freedom by always being "on the phone"'), and finally the smartphone ('people will get stupid').

Perhaps the only difference with AI in software engineering is that I am personally involved. It's because ["AI can take my job"][when-does-ai], and because it's expected to generate unmaintainable code (because, you know, humans only develop highly maintainable, clean code). Why are there so many mixed opinions? Let's take a brief look at this problem.

## Our attitude towards AI
