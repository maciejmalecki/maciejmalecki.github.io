I discovered the internet around 1995 when I had the opportunity to use it at the [Wrocław University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/). They had plenty of MS-DOS and Windows 3.11 computers with monochrome CRT monitors connected to a local network and the internet. I used tools such as *Telnet* (to access the local Unix server), *FTP*, *Minuet*, and *Gopher*. I got my first email address and used the Unix mail command to access it. Once I had managed to type the `win.exe` command and start Windows, I had access to Netscape Navigator and could browse the web. At the time, it was a brilliant idea to have a paper notepad (or a text file on a 3.5" floppy disk) to write down all the URLs that I wanted to visit later. Google.com didn't exist yet, and the early search engines, such as AltaVista and Yahoo!, weren't very good at indexing and searching. It wasn't uncommon to have a special *Links* subpage on a home page gathering a recommended links with a very varied content.

Most of the content was either files or code snippets available on some FTP servers, or the very first "home pages" created by random people with more or less interesting content. One valuable thing I discovered was that anyone could publish whatever they wanted and make it instantly accessible to others (as long as you knew how to find it). This was a complete democratisation of information at the time.

At the same time, there was Usenet, an open forum for people to discuss things. Another brick in the wall of democracy. Of course, that was where spam and trolling were born, but nobody could have predicted where it would lead.

Nevertheless, content creation was still restricted to technical people, as you usually needed to know at least HTML and a bit of CSS to create a webpage. Buying domains and setting up hosting wasn't trivial for most people either. Usenet groups were just groups, and messages could easily get lost in the flood of new posts. In the second half of the 2000s, Web 2.0 was born. Social media platforms emerged, blogging services were created, and video services such as YouTube enabled people to produce video content without any technical knowledge. At this point, I made one of the worst judgements of my life, saying that the mainstream media's monopoly was over and that we could finally have a real democracy on the internet. I was so wrong.

Initially, the wide range of social platforms became monopolised by just a few players (does anyone remember *MySpace* or *Google Plus*?). Blogs were literally killed by the monetisation model of streaming platforms. If you're familiar with IT, you'll remember that you could once find technical blog entries with solutions. Now, you have to watch a 10-minute YouTube video just to realise that it's covering a trivial case or scratching the surface. Big Tech companies that own social media started to fine-tune their algorithms to maximise their profits, which means that they are not interested in showing you content that you want to see, but rather content that will keep you on the platform for as long as possible. You can safely assume that any undesirable post you see is clickbait.

I remember having a conversation with a colleague in which I questioned the purpose of a new invention — the iPad, for example. He said that I didn't understand because the device's main purpose is to consume content. I was stunned by this answer, considering it to be *newspeak* (see [1]) and, in general, marketing gibberish. But of course, I was wrong and he was right. The internet, which was primarily designed to share information, has become a place to deliver media that mainly helps people to waste excessive amounts of time. So, rather than being a book or an article, content is now a short video or a meme. Based on what you watch, the algorithm suggests more of the same and, by gathering data about you, tries to predict your preferences. This data is a very valuable asset that can form the basis of a business model. Remember when we were excited that so many services were offered for free? Now we all understand.

The current state of the internet is as follows: We have social platforms that we can use for free. But to get anywhere, you need reach. You can provide any content you like, but to be effective, you need to follow some not-so-obvious rules. Not all content is promoted by algorithms. Aggressive clickbait, sensationalism and polarisation are the most effective ways to get more views. The more you polarise your audience, the better. If you can make people angry, they will share your content and you will get more views. This is how the internet works now.

Quite a lot of content is now created by bots. The invention of generative AI has made it even easier to generate content. This is how the World Wide Web turns into garbage.

This is why I have decided to go back to old-school blogging. Blogging without comments. It is a statically generated website that does not depend on any blogging platform. Will I be successful? I doubt it, but at least I'll have fun trying.
