<p>My name is Maciej Małecki, but I also respond to the name “Maciek”. I was born in Poland and still live there. This old-fashioned blog is about technology and everything connected with it, including some ideological and psychological rants. This is because I have been closely connected with Information Technology since childhood (the early 1990s), when I started my journey as the owner and programmer of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64 Personal Computer</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/maciek.jpg" alt="Maciek" /></p>

<p>I have worked in IT for my entire professional career, spanning 24 years (as of 2025). During this time, I have worked for numerous companies as a software engineer and software architect. I originally specialised in web development, meaning I developed applications that run over the internet and mostly interact with the end user via a webpage. Technologically speaking, this includes various forms of the JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) stack, such as JSP, JSF, EJB and CDI, as well as Spring and Spring Boot. I also later worked with the SPA (single page application) paradigm, which uses JavaScript, a programming language designed to troll people, as well as TypeScript. Various frameworks are used here, such as AngularJS, Angular and React. Some would argue that the latter is not a framework. I don’t have an opinion on this, except that, in my view, React is an engineering joke.</p>

<p>My current focus is on the application of generative AI in the field of software engineering, and the majority of my recent blog posts are connected to this area. I am also an active 6502 assembly coder who specialises in creating video games for the Commodore 64 platform.</p>
