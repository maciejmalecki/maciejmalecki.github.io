# About me and this piece of narrative

My name is Maciej Małecki, but I also respond to the name "Maciek". I was born in Poland and still live there. This old-fashioned blog is about technology and everything connected with it, including some ideological and psychological rants. This is because I have been closely connected with Information Technology since childhood (the early 1990s), when I started my journey as the owner and programmer of a [Commodore 64 Personal Computer] [c64].

I have worked in IT for my entire professional career, spanning 24 years (as of 2025). During this time, I have worked for numerous companies as a software engineer and software architect. I originally specialised in web development, meaning I developed applications that run over the internet and mostly interact with the end user via a webpage. Technologically speaking, this includes various forms of the JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) stack, such as JSP, JSF, EJB and CDI, as well as Spring and Spring Boot. I also later worked with the SPA (single page application) paradigm, which uses JavaScript, a programming language designed to troll people, as well as TypeScript. Various frameworks are used here, such as AngularJS, Angular and React. Some would argue that the latter is not a framework. I don't have an opinion on this, except that, in my view, React is an engineering joke.

My current focus is on the application of generative AI in the field of software engineering, and the majority of my recent blog posts are connected to this area. I am also an active 6502 assembly coder who specialises in creating video games for the Commodore 64 platform.
