          <p>Last time, I demonstrated how to use an AI agent for complex coding tasks. I opted for GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, but I could also have used Windsurf’s Cascade, Claude Code, or any other mature Agentic Coding tool. I tried to follow the approach outlined by Andrej Karpathy, who refers to it as Vibe Coding. Initially sceptical, I used a special prompting technique called ‘Plan and Execute’, which I had learnt about elsewhere (refer this source to learn more about “Plan and Execute” agent architecture), to try to control what the AI agent was doing to some extent. As a result, I vastly improved the agent’s efficiency and accuracy by creating a detailed plan and letting the agent execute it...</p>

          <p>With Vibe Coding it’s the same as with Agile: a reasonable idea gets ruined by misunderstanding, and this gets worse as the hype continues. This may happen if an idea is applied blindly, or even forcibly, and the result is far from what was anticipated. Losses instead of profits, and so on. Is it still not too late? First, let’s try to understand what Vibe Coding really is. We can find an informal definition on Wikipedia. By Vibe Coding, we mean a completely different approach to coding: a chatbot-based approach rather than an assistant-based one. The developer no longer works with the code directly, but rather develops via a series of prompts, letting the GenAI agent provide the implementation. The...</p>

          <p>When interviewing new candidates for the software architect position, I like to start with a few awkward questions, such as “What is architecture?”, “Who is an architect?” and “What do you do?”, before waiting for the ensuing moment of disbelief and long silence. Maybe some of them will try to beat the system by using these two rectangles and a barrel. Yes, I was there too. There are perhaps two reasonably correct answers to these questions. By “correct”, I mean “simple”, because a simple question deserves a simple answer. The first is that the architect is the most senior person on the team and knows about the things and how to avoid the traps. It’s just common sense. However, this...</p>

          <p>May was the second anniversary of my personal journey with AI, or generative AI to be precise. A few weeks ago before that moment, we had a quick chat on Zoom with some guys from all over the world, from Switzerland to New Zealand. So, the news was like, “You’ve heard that? One guy used something called ChatGPT and won a coding competition.” So, there was this chatbot, right? And it had this new tech that could understand natural English and respond to it. And get this – it could even code in almost any programming language. Wow! So as soon as I got there, I created an account and asked for a Basic v2 code doing something like bubble...</p>
